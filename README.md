# 👋 About Me

Hi! I'm Ngoc Anh Thu, but I go by Lisa :>. I’ve just completed my first year in Information Technology, and this app is inspired by a MATLAB project I worked on last semester. Yes, you read that right — a MATLAB project inspired this web application!

More importantly, this project serves as a testing ground where I apply what I've learned so far. As such, you'll likely spot some flaws at first glance. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a challenge or an opportunity to improve a web app, I hope you enjoy exploring and building upon my work.

# 🚧 Areas for Improvement
Implement sorting functionality to allow users to sort listings by price or view count, in both ascending and descending order
   
Integrate a chat feature (initial implementation used Sendbird, which has a 30-day trial limitation)
   
Enable real-time updates of listings based on selected search filters, eliminating the need to manually click the search icon.
   
Dynamically set the maximum price filter based on the highest price available in the current database (using Drizzle ORM).
Support multi-criteria search functionality
 
Ensure listing images reflect updates immediately after editing.
    
Enhance the responsiveness of the user interface to ensure optimal usability across various screen sizes and devices.
