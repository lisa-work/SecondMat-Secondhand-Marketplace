            <p>At SecondMat, we connect buyers and sellers for secondhand transactions. Since we do not sell items directly, returns are managed at the discretion of individual sellers.
                We encourage all users to clearly communicate expectations before completing any transaction to ensure a smooth experience.</p>

                            <h4 className="underline">Before Purchase:</h4>
                            <p>Buyers should carefully review item descriptions, request additional photos if needed, and ask the 
                            seller any questions before making a decision.</p>
                            <h4 className="underline">After Purchase:</h4>
                            <p>Returns are not automatically available. Sellers may choose to accept returns, exchanges, 
                                or refunds on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                            <li>If a seller agrees to accept a return, both parties must agree on the terms (who covers return costs, refund method, etc.) before proceeding.</li>
                            <li>All agreements should be clearly documented in messages for reference.</li>
