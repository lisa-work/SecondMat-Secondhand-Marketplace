                <p>At SecondMat, we provide a platform for buyers and sellers to connect and complete secondhand transactions. Because we do not directly sell or ship items, all sales are made directly between users.
                    As a result, refunds, returns, or exchanges are not guaranteed by SecondMat and must be agreed upon between the buyer and seller.</p>

                <h3><strong>Refunds Between Buyers and Sellers</strong></h3>
                    <li>Before purchasing, buyers are encouraged to inspect the item carefully and ask any necessary questions.</li>
                    <li>After the sale, it is up to the seller's discretion whether to offer a refund, exchange, or partial refund if an issue arises.</li>
                    <li>Sellers are encouraged to clearly communicate their refund policy (if any) in their item description or during the transaction.</li>

                    <li>We encourage buyers and sellers to resolve issues respectfully through communication.</li>
                    <li>If a serious dispute arises (such as fraud or misrepresentation), users can report the transaction to our support team for review.</li>

                    <li>If you agree on a refund, document the agreement in your conversation (such as in chat messages) for clarity.</li>
                    <li>Use secure, traceable payment methods if digital transactions are involved.</li>
